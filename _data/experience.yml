  summary: My previous work experience is not connected with the sphere in which I eager to get into. So, I have decided not to describe my employers here. I can say, that at all places of work I had a good relationship with the whole team. 
I am not a conflicted person, so all controversial situations were solved calmly. Also, my employers admitted the systematic approach with which I solved tasks, the ability to work in a multitasking mode and compliance with the 
deadlines of execution of assignments. I can also note my positive attitude to routine work. I can work on one thing for a long time, the main thing for me is to see the result of all the efforts. 
This applies not only to work, but also to my hobby, such as beading and crochet.
